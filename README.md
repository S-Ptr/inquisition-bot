# Inquisition Bot

Inquisition Bot is a personal project that aims to bring the Warhammer 40k RPG experience to Discord servers. It is loosely based on the Dark Heresy (2e) RPG.

The bot is built in JavaScript using the [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) library and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).

## How do I play?

So far, you don't. This is a work in progress uploaded mainly for collaborative and remote work. When a viable version is developed, an invite link for the bot will be added.

## Characters

### Character Creation

To create your characters, you will use `/dhcreatechar` Character creation is done through a sequential menu where you pick out certain traits of your character which impact the character's stats. The rest is randomly generated through dicerolls. 

Buttons highlighted in green are choices recommended by the game based on the previous choices you've made.

### Character Deletion

To remove a certain character from your retinue, you should use the `/dhterminate` command. A drop-down selection will appear which will allow you to choose the character which you want to delete.
